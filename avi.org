Humans like to see things in order. With Noweb-Ref we can structure and tangle in any order
that want. Use your discretion. Assume more notes will follow.
** TODO Style Guide
*** TODO Headings
- Completed headings
  - Transitioned out from =DONE=
  - Don't end with punctuation
- Incomplete headings
  - Do whatever you want, they are not final
- Not sure whether or not to include references in headings
- Patch was recently added to do so
*** TODO List

*** TODO Names
**** TODO Package
  - Referenced in written-language
    - Reading font
    - Capitalize whole words
    - Separate spaces with a single dash
**** TODO Code
- Monospaced markup in-line and source-blocks
**** TODO Features
- Can be express either as a [[Package]] or [[Code]]
*** TODO Source Blocks
- Tell the story
- Punctuate normally
- After periods where a new paragraph would appear is a natural place for a source block
  that expresses that which was just communicated
  - Indent like any paragraph, with an empty line separating them
- Only use a =:= when a list of blocks follows in the same way that you would format a list of text
