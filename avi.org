** TODO Philosophy

We are all seekers. We are moved by an unseen gravity. Our path is illuminated
by an unseen light. We discover those infinite and mysterious dimensions of
ourselves. In the process we change and then the world changes. Then we become
part of the world and all of creation again. Attempting to capture one path, I
recorded this journey here.

It has occurred in three stages:

1) Touched by Willful Determination (Sankalpa [fn:a8dd9e04: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankalpa_(Hindu_thought)])
2) Absorbed by the Expression of Creativity (Unique Purusha [fn:7b0aa25c: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purusha])
3) Unification With Infinite Inspiration (Universal Purusha)
**** TODO Sankalpa
When you hear the timeless whisper of Sankalpa, the inner-most chamber of your
heart will hear it. Your heart will also heighten your attention to that whisper
of love. Both will stay with you in the form of an infinite ember that is yours
to fan and flame. My whisper came simply in the form of trying to "do a good job
at what I do".

By trade I am a Software Developer [fn:6e6bfa2b: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer].
The trade is in its infancy. In many years it will be recognized among all of
the other great trades of mankind. We don't have many tools. We try to choose
the best. EMACS [fn:a18521af: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html] is
the best and I chose it. Then I set out the hone my expertise of that tool in
the form of an ideal configuration. The next section is my first thoughtful
configuration. It was an important first step and it revealed my philosophy.

The following system configuration represents a worldview focused upon the tools
being used. The title of the system is revealing. It reminds me of the question
often posed "Have you ever heard of a scalpel scientist? No? Well how about a
computer scientist?". That makes the point pretty well. That point can only be
made in retrospect. Quantifying efforts makes them visible. Visibility allows
observation and reproducibility. Those first steps were delightful and critical
to making sense of many aspects of the world. In any valuable endeavor, sincere
effort and willful-determination are required no matter the outcome. Those first
investments appear below.

****** Audience [fn:6873a93e: http://dictionary.reference.com/cite.html?qh=audience&ia=luna]

Who should be reading this?
Possibly…
- Entire document: Software engineers who want to do the above [fn:15b6c04f: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer]
  - If you are using this an excuse to learn Lisp, then know that it is really,
    really simple. Here is how it goes:
    - 3s to download Emacs
    - 3m to learn how to run code
    - 3h to learn the IDE
    - 3d to master the language
- Decisions & Assembly: Existing Emacs users… daily usage and non-trivial customization
  An interest in using package/el-get/cask and org-mode literate programming are the only thing that would motivate anyone to read this really.

This is an unfinished and experimental document. All successes with it
may be attributed to all of the folks who provided these wonderful tools. All
failures with it may be attributed to me.

Why should they be reading this?

- conservation :: "prevention of injury, decay, waste, or loss" [fn:c6f84dda: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Conservation]
- computer files :: "a file maintained in computer-readable form" [fn:49968ef8: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/computer%20file]

Pursuing these goals, in the manner of literate programming, also serves to
better myself, as captured here:

- COTS libraries
- Capture rationale and reasons along with things I did or didn't do and why
- Includes links to everything

Note: How you break up the initialization of a system like Emacs is mostly
personal preference. Although org-mode (Babel) lets you tell a story, I was
coming from a pretty structured configuration file to begin with. In the future, it
might be interesting to look at this system from scratch in terms of doing
literate programming. Fortunately, it provides that freedom out of the box.

- Went stunningly well

- This configuration was developed organically quite differently from the original idea
- Literate programming allowed an insanely flexible and freeing experience
- This one massive experience for me made a powerful, positive, life-changing
  impression on me
- My laziness and poor habits were made quite apparent going through the efforts
  to consider, realize, and support this system
- Before beginning I had no value system about testing this kind of artifact

A virgin-installation of EMACS comes with Org-Mode already installed. It is stable, reliable, and
predictable. It is a fine software product. AVI needs access to cutting edge features, immediate hot-fixes, and easy patch
creation. The easiest way to do this is the "Using Org's git repository" option. Before you start this set up, find out what
version of Org-Mode is built-in.

Start EMACS with the =-Q= argument so that only the built-libraries are loaded. Open the =*scratch*= buffer and evaluate the
expression =(org-version)=. Note it because the  code will load a newer version of Org-Mode. Quit EMACS.

Follow these instructions in a terminal:
- =cd ~=
- =mkdir src=
- =cd ~/src/=
- =git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git=
- =cd org-mode/=
- =make autoloads=

Load the Org-Mode core distribution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/org-mode/lisp")
#+end_src

Load the Org-Mode-Contributions distribution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/org-mode/contrib/lisp")
#+end_src

Start EMACS normally.
