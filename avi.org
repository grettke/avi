** TODO Philosophy

We are all seekers. We are moved by an unseen gravity. Our path is illuminated
by an unseen light. We discover those infinite and mysterious dimensions of
ourselves. In the process we change and then the world changes. Then we become
part of the world and all of creation again. Attempting to capture one path, I
recorded this journey here.

It has occurred in three stages:

1) Touched by Willful Determination (Sankalpa [fn:a8dd9e04: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankalpa_(Hindu_thought)])
2) Absorbed by the Expression of Creativity (Unique Purusha [fn:7b0aa25c: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purusha])
3) Unification With Infinite Inspiration (Universal Purusha)
**** TODO Sankalpa
When you hear the timeless whisper of Sankalpa, the inner-most chamber of your
heart will hear it. Your heart will also heighten your attention to that whisper
of love. Both will stay with you in the form of an infinite ember that is yours
to fan and flame. My whisper came simply in the form of trying to "do a good job
at what I do".

By trade I am a Software Developer [fn:6e6bfa2b: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer].
The trade is in its infancy. In many years it will be recognized among all of
the other great trades of mankind. We don't have many tools. We try to choose
the best. EMACS [fn:a18521af: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html] is
the best and I chose it. Then I set out the hone my expertise of that tool in
the form of an ideal configuration. The next section is my first thoughtful
configuration.

- After periods where a new paragraph would appear is a natural place for a source block
  that expresses that which was just communicated
  - Indent like any paragraph, with an empty line separating them
- Only use a =:= when a list of blocks follows in the same way that you would format a list of text

A virgin-installation of EMACS comes with Org-Mode already installed. It is stable, reliable, and
predictable. It is a fine software product. AVI needs access to cutting edge features, immediate hot-fixes, and easy patch
creation. The easiest way to do this is the "Using Org's git repository" option. Before you start this set up, find out what
version of Org-Mode is built-in.

Start EMACS with the =-Q= argument so that only the built-libraries are loaded. Open the =*scratch*= buffer and evaluate the
expression =(org-version)=. Note it because the  code will load a newer version of Org-Mode. Quit EMACS.

Follow these instructions in a terminal:
- =cd ~=
- =mkdir src=
- =cd ~/src/=
- =git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git=
- =cd org-mode/=
- =make autoloads=

Load the Org-Mode core distribution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/org-mode/lisp")
#+end_src

Load the Org-Mode-Contributions distribution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/org-mode/contrib/lisp")
#+end_src

Start EMACS normally.
